        <p>My name is Ethan Foltz, I'm from Vancouver, Washington. Fun fact, Usually when I tell people this,<br>
            they either think I'm saying that I'm from Washington DC, or from Canada, neither of which are true.</p>
        <p>I'm studying Computer Engineering. I'm not sure what exactly I do, but I think I will have lots of good <br>
            job opportunities with the skills I gain from this path. also, I enjoy a lot of hobbies in which better <br>
            understanding of computers would be pretty helpful.</p>
        <p>I have too many hobbies to list, but my most recent hobbies are snowboarding, playing/creating music,<br>
            building computers, going to the gym, solving rubiks cubes, making art, and occasionally playing video games.</p>
