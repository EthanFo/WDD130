      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>my purpose is to inspire and enable young adults 
        to become informed of the effects different aspects of the internet have 
        on the human brain and to take control of their digital habits. our years 
        as a young adult are very significant for the healthy development of our 
        brains and reward systems, and improper internet usage can have 
        debilitating effects.

      <h3>What is this about?</h3>
      <p>
        Target audience:
        The target audience of my website will be young adults who are on a journey for self improvement. 
        I personally wish that there was more information on what the effects of my digital habits were, 
        and I wish I could find Ideas on how I could modify my habits so I can feel more fulfilled.
        <br>
        Necessary information:
        This website will not be for everyone by default. It will most likely only appeal to those who 
        have recognized that there is something within themself that they would like to change. The most
        necessary information to have when entering this website is an understanding that there is a 
        connection between the entertainment we consume, and the way we feel about ourselves, our lives,
        and how we feel in general. Besides that, a basic understanding of cause and effect in the 
        context of the relationship between your behaviors and feelings.
        <br>
        Questions this site will answer:
        This website will help answer questions such as: 
        How does digital entertainment affect the human brain?
        What are normal digital habits?
        Is our digital culture healthy?
        What can we do?
        And will assist individuals in finding answers to these questions:
        What are my digital habits?
        How do my digital habits affect my brain?
        What are some things I could try to feel more fulfilled?
        <br>
        Why this website?
        This website will provide a compilation of very specific information that other websites may not have. 
        I haven’t seen any other website like this. This website will be a compendium of my understanding of 
        this subject based on my personal experience as well as knowledge that I have gained from other sources. 
        This website is more focused on helping an individual explore Ideas rather than simply being a dump of 
        boring scientific information. Scientific information is important and necessary to understand the 
        subject matter of this website, but it can get quite boring if you have to read too much of it without 
        a break. Personally, I tend to lose focus, and then I end up walking away having learned very little. 
        I enjoy exploring Ideas and solving problems, so that is what I hope to make this website assist others 
        in doing so.

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        What process will be used to accomplish the purpose?
        The information on this website will be ordered in somewhat of a timeline of the process. 
        The first step will be self awareness and recognition of personal habits, and the last will 
        be several ideas that the user may choose to apply. There is no endpoint, because improving 
        habits takes longer than simply looking at a website. It is up to the user to finish the process 
        in the way that they see the most fit. Everyone has a different understanding of things, and 
        everyone is at a different point in their personal journey. This website will be formatted in a way 
        that anyone will be able to skip through information to find what they are looking for. It will be 
        easy to skip around the website using links and expandable menus which are all clearly labeled and 
        in a specific order. This website will not be a perfect fix-all for all users, but it will provide 
        new ideas for the user as they navigate through the website.
        <br>
        Website Activities:
        This website will be primarily informational, but I would like to add some interactive features so 
        users can have a more personalized experience. An example of a personalized experience would be 
        multiple choice surveys or questions that a user could answer after which the user will be guided to 
        information that may help them find the solutions they seek.
        <br>
        Website content:
        This website will consist of expandable menus and other interactive navigation that will allow the 
        user to explore the website and find specific information that they might be looking for. This will 
        not simply be an information dump, but rather carefully organized and sorted information. This 
        organization will help the user find inspiration by exploring ideas and considering changes they 
        could make in their own life.
